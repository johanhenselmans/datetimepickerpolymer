datetimepicker
==========

datetime picker dart polymer component

based on https://github.com/jrofurtado/datepicker, but added hours and minutes
and made sure date components remained the same after changing month, day, year, hour or minute.

Thought it would be better to make a separate datetime picker instead of improving Jo√£o Furtado's
so that one that just needed a date picker did not have to be bothered with all kinds of settings.

16-6-2014: Since polymer in dart seems to be stabilized, decided to try to get it running as a
polymer element. Still work in progress.
